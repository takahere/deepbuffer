# Language Guidelines

1.  **Internal Thinking (Chain of Thought)**: Always think and plan in **English**. This helps in maintaining logic clarity and consistency with code (which is in English).
2.  **External Communication (User Response)**: Always respond to the user in **Japanese** (unless the user explicitly asks for English).
3.  **Code Comments**: Write code comments in **English** generally, but use Japanese for domain-specific logic if necessary for the Japanese user.
